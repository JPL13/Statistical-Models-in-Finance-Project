# Investment Portfolio Analysis

I constructed a portfolio using 30 stocks selected from http://finance.yahoo.com. These stocks are from 5 industries classified by https://finance.yahoo.com/industries. I constructed my portfolios using monthly data from 01-Jan-2012 to 01-Jan-2017  (5 years). For the testing period use monthly data from 01-Jan-2017 to 31-Mar-2020. 
The portfolios are constructed using single index model, constant correlation model, multi-index model, multigroup model, equal allocation. 
The perfomance of all portfolios are compared with S&P500 in the testing period.
